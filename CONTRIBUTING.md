## ðŸ”’ Branch Protection Rules

To maintain code quality, we have branch protection rules in place:  
âœ… All changes must go through a **Pull Request (PR)**.  
âœ… PRs require at least **one approving review** before merging.  
âœ… **Force pushes and direct commits to `main` are restricted**.  
âœ… All PRs must pass status checks before being merged.
